Multi-Condition Analysis
The study examines three distinct operating scenarios with varying back pressure conditions:
Case 1: Over-Expanded Flow (Low Back Pressure)

Flow Characteristics: Supersonic flow throughout divergent section
Exit Conditions: Under-expanded jet formation
Shock Structure: External oblique shocks at nozzle exit
Performance: Maximum thrust but potential flow instability

Case 2: Shock-in-Nozzle Flow (Moderate Back Pressure)

Flow Characteristics: Normal shock wave inside divergent section
Shock Location: Variable position based on pressure ratio
Flow Transition: Supersonic to subsonic across shock
Exit Conditions: Subsonic flow with pressure recovery

Case 3: Separated Flow (High Back Pressure)

Flow Characteristics: Flow separation due to adverse pressure gradient
Separation Point: Downstream of shock wave location
Flow Structure: Recirculation zones and unsteady behavior
Performance: Significant thrust loss and flow instability

Critical Flow Parameters

Pressure Ratio Analysis: P_back/P_total effects on flow structure
